    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        From leche flan to halo-halo, the Philippines is anything but short of delicious local desserts to try. We love to experiment with various sugary ingredients to find that perfect balance of flavor. And with its comfortingly velvety texture and mildly sweet taste, Ube Halaya is among those deliciously well-balanced desserts. Some people also call it ube jalea, ube jam or ube haleya. But they all stand for the same consistently creamy and delicious dessert.
