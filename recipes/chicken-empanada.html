    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Empanadas are a simple yet filling and delicious turnover pastry, and despite their compact half moon size are meals in themselves. No pretense necessary –– wonderful and juicy, empanadas are the no-frill snack everyone will love.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>Ingredients we will need to make the yummiest Chicken Empanada</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Meat: Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Vegetables: Onion, garlic, potato, carrot</li>
        <li>Seasonings: Salt, ground black pepper, chicken cube</li>
        <li>Sweetener: Sugar</li>
        <li>Fruits: Green peas, Raisin</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>How to make Chicken Empanada:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparation</li>
            <p>
                Like in every recipe, make sure to prepare all your ingredients beforehand to save time. For this chicken empanada recipe, I use 1 ½ lbs of boneless chicken breast. Before cooking, I cut the chicken into cubes. I also dice my potatoes and carrots during preparation. This chicken empanada recipe calls for 1 cup of each. Lastly, the onion and garlic need prep too. We’ll only need one of each, and the onion doesn’t have to be too big –– just medium sized will do. After mincing both of them, you’re ready to start cooking!
            </p>
            <p>
                There are two equally important parts to cooking Chicken Empanada. One is making the flavorful, mouthwatering filling, and the other is the flaky dough it comes wrapped in.
            </p>
        <li>The Filling</li>
            <p>
                The first step to making Chicken Empanada is making the filling. An empanada is nothing without its hearty, delicious, savory insides. Pour 2 tablespoons of cooking oil into a pan and saute your minced garlic and onion in it. Add the chicken you’ve cut now, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you’ve been cooking the chicken for about 5 minutes –– or once it’s turned a nice light brown, whichever comes first –– add in some water and half a piece of chicken cube. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes. Afterwards, put in the carrots and potatoes you prepared beforehand. Let the pan simmer again, but now for only half the time. Lastly, add in your 1 cup of green peas, ¼ cup of raisins, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. Let it simmer once more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sprinkle ½ teaspoon of salt and pepper over your filling after having let it cook. Take a little bite of your filling to see if it’s to your satisfaction. Once it is, turn off the heat, drain the excess liquid, and set it aside for now.
            </p>
        <li>The Dough</li>
            <p>
                Now it’s time to make the dough! We start doing this by combining all the dry ingredients in one mixing bowl. These ingredients include: 3 cups of flour, 4 tablespoons of sugar, half a teaspoon of baking powder, and half a teaspoon of salt. Mix these all together in one bowl using a wire whisk.

                Cut your 1 cup of butter into small, thin pieces. The butter you’re using should be cold and solidified. Once you’ve cut them, toss them into the mixing bowl. Add water in gradually (about 6 tablespoons will do) and mix the ingredients well. A dough should form a while after. If you have it onhand, a pastry blender can help make the process even easier!
            </p>
            <p>
                When the dough has been formed, it’s now time to divide it into individual pieces. To do this, grab a piece from your mixture and roll it in your hand, forming a round, ball-like shape. Use up all the dough in this way, and set it aside somewhere cold for about 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes, take your spherical dough out and prepare to flatten it. Use a rolling pin to flatten your round dough pieces, while still maintaining its circular shape. Without a rolling pin, you can also use your palm to press the dough up against a flat surface. And now –– it’s finally time to fully assemble your empanadas!
            </p>
        <li>The Empanada</li>
            <p>
                Take your filling out from where you’d set it aside prior. Using a spoon, arrange about a quarter to half a cup of filling at the middle of the flattened dough. Fold the dough so the opposite ends meet, and it forms something like a half moon in shape. Press the edges together and seal it well. When you’ve consumed all the filling and folded up all the dough, prepare 1 egg by cracking it and separating the white from the yolk. You’ll only need the egg whites for this; beat them lightly, adding in water and mixing every so often. Afterwards, brush the egg wash over your folded empanadas for a glaze.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pre-heat your oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (roughly 200 degrees Celsius) for about 10 minutes. During this time, prepare your baking tray by either putting wax paper atop it or greasing it well. Arrange the half moon doughs on the tray before putting them in the oven. Let them bake for about 25 minutes. When the 25 minutes are up, remove them from the oven –– and voila! Your delicious chicken empanadas are ready to be served, piping hot and delicious. Share it with your loved ones and enjoy! This serves six people perfectly, and so you can count on leftovers if you want to eat with a smaller group.
