    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Truffle pasta is often associated with sophistication and luxury because it can come at a pretty high price in restaurants. And once the server hands you that plate of rich, buttery pasta, you will easily understand why. This is the kind of dish that has an unforgettable taste, and is something you can only really get with truffle oil. But this is not all too complicated to make at home. You can easily create some of your own Truffle Mushroom Pasta!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Fettucine</li>
        <li>Baby Bella Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Truffle Oil</li>
        <li>Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <p>How to Make It:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cooking the fettuccine</li>
            <p>
                Grab ½ lb. of fettuccine. Take a look at the package instructions, and cook these according to what is indicated. Just set them aside afterwards.
            </p>
        <li>Preparing the mushrooms</li>
            <p>
                Put 3 tablespoons of butter in a pan. Apply heat to let this melt. Then pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Add 8 ounces of sliced baby bella mushroom, and just sauté this. Keep this up until you get the mushrooms nice and soft. 
            </p>
        <li>Adding some seasonings</li>
            <p>
                Put 35 grams of Knorr Cream of Mushroom in a container with 1 ½ cups of water. Now mix these together, and then pour this into your pan. Also toss in 1 sprig of rosemary you’ve chopped. Afterwards, cook everything using the lowest heat setting for 10 minutes.
            </p>
        <li>Working truffle oil into the dish</li>
            <p>
                Now let’s place ¼ cup of heavy cream alongside 1 teaspoon of truffle oil in the pan. Add some ground black pepper to taste, and then ¼ cup of grated parmesan cheese.
            </p>
        <li>Combining the sauce and pasta</li>
            <p>
                Then put your cooked fettuccine inside. Toss this into the sauce, and make sure that you coat this completely. And once you finish this, you can just transfer this to a serving plate. Top this all off with 2 tablespoons of chopped parsley, and some more parmesan. And that’s it! Good job on making some irresistible Truffle Mushroom Pasta!
